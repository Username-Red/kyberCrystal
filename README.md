# Overview

This program handles the basic logic and functionality of a Kyber Crystal that would go inside a lightsaber. That includes ignition, deactivation, humming, color, and animations for each ignition, hum, and deactivation. It is a highly scalable framework that I will absolutely be using in the future.


I wrote this program not only because its very cool, but also as proof that you can create a robust lightsaber that can outperform official disney lightsaber products and rival other high end third party lightsabers, all this with limited experience in arduio and C++.

# Future Work

- Item 1: Switch out the basic rgb led for a 1 led neopixel base light.
- Item 2: Add a blade using either a 7 led neopixel base light or addressable strip lights inside the blade.
- Item 3: Sound board that has sounds from various lightsabers that can be stroed and added
- Item 4: a movement sensor to detect clashes and swing actions
